ZygosityEvaluator involves two classes: ZygosityEvaluator and PopulationDataStructure.
Main in PopulationDataStructure is suitable for testing PopulationDataStructure. To test
the ZygosityEvaluator, we will analyze, by hand, the zygosity of the IBS population in 
100.vcf. 

The indices of the IBS people are: 
395  396  397  398  399  400  403  404  405  406  407  408  409  410  
So we will use awk to separate these values and evaluate the heterozygous and homozygous 
counts by hand.


tail -1 100.vcf | awk '{print NF}'
answer is:  1101


1101-1092 = 9 -> adjusted indicies are x+9
So the adjusted indices are: 
$404, $405, $406, $407, $408, $409, $412, $413, $414, $415, $416, $417, $418, $419
 
Get the pertinent VCF columns.
    awk -F\\t '{print $1, $2, $405, $406, $407, $408, $409, $410, $413, $414, $415, $416, $417, $418, $419, $420}' 100.vcf > VCF_for_IBS

Get the pertinent output records, they are HomozygousRefMatchCount, HomozygousRefFraction, HeterozygousCount, HeterozygousFraction 
    awk -F\` '{print $1, $2, $47, $48, $49, $50}' formatted_table > IBS_only_formatted_table
